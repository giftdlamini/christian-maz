            <p>Christain-Maz's ability to recognise skill and talent gave birth to his artistic career, and it's been almost six years
                since he emerged from the shadows and made a name for himself. Over the past few years he has been able to achieve a countless number of awards,
                which gave him the platorm to expand his harizons throughout the entire nation. As a young man, who is fully aware of the drastic problems the world is currently facing,
                in his poems he addresses quite a number of them including but not limited to injustice, poverty, abuse etc... Christain-Maz values interdependence and this is one of his
                principles that led him to collaborate with a variety of artists including other Poets, instrumentalists, musicians, song-writers and he even went on to support the drama industry.
                He is famously known for poetry but over the past few years he has also revealed his enticing drama skills during his perfomances on stage. His career took a huge turn 
                in social media due to the increment of his followers, now he is a brand ambassador for multiple companies and institutions. He is a god-fearing young man who solely believes that
                his entire career is a grace from God, and throughout his speeches he argues all young talented artists to acknowledge that. Christain is still making his way through the industry and we can't wait to be 
                astonished by what he got up in his sleeves! </p>
